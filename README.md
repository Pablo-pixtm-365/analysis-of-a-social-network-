# analysis-of-a-social-network-
we will work with the analysis of the social network Lastfm, a social network dedicated to the collection of data on artists or songs to find and give statistics to users. The network we are working with is only from Asian countries and contains a total of 7624 nodes and 27806 links.



we will see which are the important or interesting nodes in different aspects, for example which are the most important nodes in terms of number of connections, which are the nodes that can spread information
more efficiently, which are the nodes that could be eliminated and lose connection of important information, etc. all this thanks to the centrality measures. Also, how the degree distribution can help us determine which is the most appropriate model for the network, whether or not there are hubs in the network and find the value of ”degree exponent” (γ) and finally the communities that can be found in the network
